#User Needs
The user needs this app addresses is an inventory app, with a forgot password option for users

#Screens and Features
A login page with a forgot password option was neccessary, a database page, and a mobile number input page. My UI kept users in mind by the simple layout, and minimal buttons to click for the user. I chose a soft blue background with bolded black text for a easy contrast on the eyes but has a flow for scrolling effect

#Approach
I started with doing the UI design on the design part of Android Studio, and when I went to code the backend I realized it was easier to hard code both the front and back end development. This allowed for a better placement, and I was able to create my own Id's

#Functional
I was able to use the Android Emulator using an Android Phone, with Tiramisu

#Innovation
I had to watch a lot of videos to get everything right, and I wanted to make it more creative than another
